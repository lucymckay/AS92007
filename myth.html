      <h2>The Myth</h2>

      <p>After many years of fighting, Te Maia and his Iwi settled at Auckland Point. But Te Maia was bored of his life, so one morning he left. He climbed over the Puke Tirohia Marama Grampians to the Waimea mountain ranges. He arrived late in the afternoon, so when he found a cave, he went inside to rest. To his surprise, there was a giant nest made of sticks, leaves, and feathers. He climbed into it and quickly fell asleep.</p>
      <p>When Te Maia woke, he found he was trapped by a great weight above him. Opening his eyes, he discovered that a giant eagle had entered the cage and was sitting in the nest on top of him. Many hours later, the bird finally left. Te Maia climbed out of the nest and went to get a drink of water. Suddenly he heard a loud screech as the eagle returned. Climbing back into the nest, Te Maia hid himself among the branches.</p> 
      <p>While he was hiding in the nest, Te Maia felt something moving next to him. Beside him was a baby eagle, just hatching from its shell. At the same time, the larger bird climbed into the nest, carrying a large fish in its beak. The bird stripped off pieces of the fish and fed them to both Te Maia and the baby eagle. This become the daily return for the following months.</p>
        <p>While the mother eagle was out hunting, Te Maia would play his flute for the baby, which he named Hokioi-Okioi, and teach him to fly. Eventually, the day came that the mother eagle did not return. When Te Maia and Hokioi-Okioi ran out of food, they decided to go look for more. Te Maia climbed onto Hokioi-Okioi's back and the pair flew out into the clear sky. They flew over Motueka, Takaka, te Matau a Maui, Farewell Spit, Karamea, Whakatue, and back to their cave in the Richmond Hills. During one flight, they flew over Te Maia's Iwi. Here, Te Maia felt a great desire to be back with his people.</p>
                <p>Before leaving his friend forever, Te Maia renamed him Kahurangi, the same colour as they sky they had flown across together. As Te Maia returned to his tribe, he and Kagurangi embraced in hongi and they said a silent karakia in farewell. Then, Kahurangi soared upwards and returned to the mountains. As he left, he cried "Hokioi! Hokioi! Hokio!"</p>
