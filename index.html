      <h2>About the myth</h2>

      <p>Hokioi-Okioi/Kahurangi was most likely a Haast's Eagle- an extinct species of Eagle that lived in the South Island of New Zealand. Haast Eagle bones have been found around the Nelson area, which supports the idea that the eagle in the myth was a Haast's Eagle. Many rock draws in the top of the South Island have been seen of giant Eagles, which further supports the myth.</p>

      <p>The name Hokioi-Okioi came from the eagle's cry, which sounded like he was saying 'Hokioi'. </p> 
      
      <p>It is said that when it is winter, you can see Te Maia lying in the Richmond mountains, looking at the sky. By his head, you can also see Kahurangi with his beak tucked in beside his friend. Janice Manson, a Maori teacher, has said that the easiest way to see Te Maia and Kahurangi is at Appleby road in late Autumn.</p>
